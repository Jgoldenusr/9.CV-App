## About the project

This page was made for the "CV" challenge on TheOdinProject.com.

The page was meant to showcase the React skills learned so far, mainly component creation and state management.

The page allows you to create a CV with dynamic data. You can also have a preview of the CV or download it in pdf format.

You can test the demo [here.](https://github.com/Jgoldenusr/9.CV-App)
